Socket examples for humans
===

Because writing and reading C code is inhumane, we present a number of
studies in Haskell aimed to shed some light on how protocols get implemented,
how data gets from one computer to another, what sockets are and what they
aren't.

For ease of understanding, I'm not using do-notation in these studies.

I'll gladly merge equivalent code in other programming languages to this
